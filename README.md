# E-Commerce-Back-End https://img.shields.io/badge/lisence-MIT-red
  
## Description
Week 14 challenge to build the back end for an e-commerce site by modifying starter code. Must be configured using Express.js API to use Sequelize to interact with MySql database. Given a functional Express.js API, when the user adds database name, mySQ@L username, and mySQL password, then they are able to connect to a database using Sequelize. When the user enters schema and seed commands, then a development database is created and seeded with test data. When the user enters the command to invoke the application, then the server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database. When the user opens API GET routes in Postman for categories, products or tags, then the data for each of those routes is displayed in a formatted JSON. When the user tests API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Postman, then they are able to successfully create, update, and delete data in the database.

## Installation
